# React Todo App

This project is the result of clone coding using example code from a React textbook. It's built with React Native and showcases the creation of a Todo application.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### 1. Project Setup

First, create the project using `create-react-app`.

```bash
yarn create react-app todo-app
```

### 2. Installing Dependencies

Navigate to your project directory and install necessary libraries with yarn.

```bash
cd todo-app
yarn add sass classnames react-icons
```

### 3. Using React Icons

You can use various icons from `react-icons`. For reference, visit [React Icons](https://react-icons.netlify.com/#/icons/md).

Example code to import an icon:

```javascript
import { iconName } from 'react-icons/md';
```

### 4. Optimizing Rendering

For better performance, use `react-virtualized` to optimize rendering.

```bash
yarn add react-virtualized
```
